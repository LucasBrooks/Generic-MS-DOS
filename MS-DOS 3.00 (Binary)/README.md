# MS-DOS 3.00 SYSINIT Object Files

MS-DOS 3.00 is extremely rare, and the only files available (IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM) came from an ACT Apricot Xi disk. I have disassembled the SYSINIT portion of that Apricot IO.SYS to produce these object files. These object files will allow you to boot MS-DOS 3.00 on PC-Compatible hardware. I have not yet disassembled the PC-DOS 3.00 DOS BIOS, so right now you must link them with the MS-DOS 2.11 DOS BIOS code or your own BIOS code.

I probably will not upload the reconstructed source code of the MS-DOS 3.00 SYSINIT because it is pretty ugly. These objects may not be perfect or identical to the objects distributed by Microsoft, because after all they came from the disassembly of a non-PC-Compatible DOS BIOS.
